# Caesar Cipher
A text based Caesar Cipher made in C++
## What is a Caesar Cipher? How does it work?
A Caesar Cipher is a cryptograhic cipher which encrypts your message. 
The cipher got its name from Julius Caesar who is said to have used it to protect messages.
It is a type of substitution cipher which works by shifting the alphabet a set amount.
It is not recommended to use to encrypt your messages for important things since it would be easily broken by hand.
## Example
I want to shift the message "Hello World" by 4 
The alphabet would shift by 4 so A would become E
| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |
| E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | A | B | C | D |
So my message would go from "Hello World" to "Lipps Asvph"
